# 🛒 React Shopping Cart App

A modern shopping cart application built with **React** that demonstrates the use of key React hooks — `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useRef`.  
It allows users to add or remove products, calculate totals and discounts, and simulate checkout events — all with a clean dark-themed interface.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

| Hook | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `useReducer` | Manages cart state and actions like add, remove, and clear |
| `useMemo` | Memoizes expensive computations (total, discount, final price) |
| `useCallback` | Prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing event handlers |
| `useRef` | Tracks number of checkout actions without causing re-renders |
